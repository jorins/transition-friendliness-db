# Transition-friendliness database
This repository documents how transition-friendly various services and products across the web are.

## This document is a work in progress
Criteria have not been finalised, and a pipeline for easy contribution is still in development. Anonymous contributions are not yet possible, though you can still write to me and I can add your testimonial anonymously.

## What does all that mean?
> Gender transitioning is the process of changing one's gender presentation and/or sex characteristics to accord with one's internal sense of gender identity â€“ the idea of what it means to be a man or a woman, or to be non-binary or genderqueer.

\- [Wikipedia - Transitioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_transitioning)

A large part of transitioning is within social circles, which can include changing name, contact information, and many other details in many online contexts. For those who have a large online presence they wish to preserve, this entails a lot of labour. Lots of forms to fill out, support pages to dig through, tickets to write, and more. This database aims to define a standard for how an organisation or service can be supportive of its trans members in their transition, as well as keeping a record of how well organisations and services live up to this standard. Organisations that fail to meet the standard are strongly encouraged to submit an update through a pull request if they decide to change their procedure.

## Criteria and rating

### Basic criteria
These are the criteria for receiving a passing grade, along with short explanations of why they are necessary to help trans users:

1. **All personal information can be changed**: this includes name, gender, pronouns, and any other fields related to one's transition. This includes both privately and publicly shown information. Usernames, account names, character names, and similar will be included here. Even if they aren't guaranteed to be personal information, they may be used as such. Publicly facing information that is incorrect may risk the user being misgendered. Incorrect private information might not pose a risk to the user, but many trans people find it painful to have to see their deadname and incorrect information. A mismatch in public information (for example, a display name being updated but a shown account name not being updated) can risk outing a trans user and their old identity can be tied to their new. This creates a risk of harassment and doxxing.
2. **Changing information is free**: there should be no costs associated with any aspect of transitioning one's account. Transitioning is an expensive process that can involve changing registered personal information with the state, paying for medication, therapists and psychologists, surgery, drastically changing wardrobes, and much more. To support trans people as a service provider, you should understand that transitioning is a hard process that is already very costly for trans people and it is unethical to ask more money of them to perform what is a necessary step in their own journey towards living as their true selves.
3. **Transition of an account is possible without data-loss**: no information stored by the user should be lost when changing, or be required to be manually transferred by the user. Creating a new account can qualify, but only if all service-related data is preserved. Some trans people might opt to create entirely new accounts so as to make sure there is no connection between old and new, but others might find themselves needing account-tied information to be retained, such as game purchases on a game store or stored projects in a creative program. The latter group needs to be accounted for as not everyone can or wants to start with a clean slate.
4. **Transition must be private and discreet**: a request to transition an account should not have to be filed in public as this puts the user at a risk of harassment. There should be no announcements made to others when information is changed. Historical information, such as old comments mentioning the user by name, must be either removable or editable (even if such would be up to the user). It is up to the person transitioning to choose whether to share information regarding their transition and to choose whom to share it with.
5. **Information should not be required to match state-issued ID:** a lot of, if not most, nation states make it hard, nearly impossible, or even entirely impossible to change the gender marker and name registered in their databases and on their citizens' IDs. As a result, a lot of trans people live with incorrect names and gender markers on their ID. No one but the person in question is an authority on who they are, not even a state. They are the ones to be trusted, not the bureaucratic gears of nations.
6. **Non-binary individuals must be able to represent themselves:** any gendered fields such as gender, honourifics, and pronouns, must be able to accurately represent non-binary users' preferences. Gender fields are not a requirement in most situations and having none fullfils this criteria but when they are present, the user should be able to input their own information in text inputs. If that's not possible, gender fields should have an "other" option, separate from "prefer not to tell" or blank input. Honourific fields should include the option "Mx." or an otherwise neutral choice. Pronoun fields should have an option for "they/them". Non-binary people have always existed and will always exist. As such, they deserve to be able to show that where asked for their gender. Opt-out does not count as non-binary choices as it implies that the user either wants to not provide the information and not that they are non-binary.

A passing grade is denoted with one star in the database. A non-passing grade is denoted with a frowning face.

### Additional criteria
There are additional criteria for making transition even easier.
1. **Single interface:** transitioning should be possible from a single page or a set of directly related pages. You should not have to use two distinctly different interfaces to change different pieces of information. E-mail, phone calls, and more will be counted as their own interfaces.
2. **Self-service:** transitioning should be possible to do without having to receive human support.
3. **Non-incrimating process:** the user should not have to present more personal information than what was given upon account creation in order to change stored information. It is reasonable for a bank to require you to show ID to change stored information, but it's not as reasonable that an online service that has never seen your ID before transitioning would ask the same.
4. **Non-binary individuals must be able to represent themselves _accurately_:** services non-binary users can, in addition to any pre-made choices, specify gender, honourifics, and pronouns in text. Multiple pronouns and neo-pronouns must be usable.
5. **Reasonably fast execution:** submitting a request to change account information and subsequently having it performed should not take more than a week at most.

One star is given per additional criteria, but only if a passing grade is reached.

### Hostility towards trans people
Services and organisations that show hostility or malice towards trans people will be denoted as such.

## How to submit a testimonial
Send a pull request with the necessary information. This is a WIP. Hopefully this will be streamlined so that they can be submitted through issues and from people without GitHub accounts.
